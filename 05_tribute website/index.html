          <h2>MISSILE MAN OF INDIA</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</b> was an eminent Indian aerospace
            scientist and the 11th President of India, serving from 2002 to
            2007. Known as the "Missile Man of India" for his crucial role in
            the development of India's missile and space technology, Dr. Kalam
            was a key architect of the nation's ballistic missile and satellite
            launch vehicle programs. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram,
            Tamil Nadu, he rose from humble beginnings to become one of India's
            most beloved scientists and leaders. Dr. Kalam's contributions
            extended beyond science and technology; he was a visionary thinker,
            educator, and a passionate advocate for youth empowerment and
            education. His inspirational speeches and books, such as "Wings of
            Fire" and "Ignited Minds," motivated millions of young Indians to
            dream big and work towards making those dreams a reality. His
            presidency was marked by humility, simplicity, and a focus on
            transforming India into a developed nation. Dr. Kalam passed away on
            July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture to students, a fitting end
            to a life dedicated to education and inspiring the next generation.
            He remains a symbol of resilience, innovation, and hope for millions
            of people in India and around the world.
